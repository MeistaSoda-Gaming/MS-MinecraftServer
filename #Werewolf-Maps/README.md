# Werewolf Maps

Here are 2 maps created by MeistaSoda for the purpose of playing "Werewolf".

- Forstendune (big map)
- Werewolfed (small map)

Copy either one of these 2 folders and paste it in the main server folder.
Rename the already existing **world** folder into f.e. ***world_old***. After that you can rename the folder of the copied map into ***world***.

Once the map is copied and renamed, you can start the server and enjoy playing it.

## Troubleshoot

If your server application window crashes with the new map, go into the folder `world/players` and delete all player files.
After that, trying to start the server should be successful.
